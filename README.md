# CreditCardApp

A Flutter Mobile app that allows the submission of credit card details for validation.

## Requirements

Build a Flutter mobile application that can do the following:

- Allow the user to submit credit card details. Details should include: Card Number, Card Type, CVV, Issuing Country.
- Ability to infer Card Type from Credit Card number would be beneficial.
- Check the specified country to make sure it doesn’t exist in a list of banned countries.
- Make the list of banned countries configurable.
- If the card is valid – store it in local storage. 
SEMBAST NoSQL Local DB

- Display all the credit cards that have been captured during the session.
- Don’t capture the same card twice.
- Please also add the ability to scan a credit card (examples attached), and pre-populate the card number and infer the cart type.
- Authorization is not necessary for the purposes of this test.
